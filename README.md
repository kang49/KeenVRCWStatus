<h2>About the project</h2>
<p>This project allows you to check the status of your VRChat world through Python code and simulate updates to your
  heart rate on VRChat.</p>

<h2>Getting started</h2>
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>In order to use this project, you will need the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Python 3.7 or later</li>
  <li>The Selenium library for Python</li>
</ul>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:</p>
<pre>
pip install selenium
</pre>
<p>Next, download the appropriate web driver for your browser and make sure it is in your system's PATH.</p>
<p>The following modules are also required for this project:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>lib2to3.pgen2.driver</code>: This module is a part of the lib2to3 library, which is used to support Python 2
    to 3 code translation. It is not clear from the code provided what specific functionality from this module is being
    used.</li>
  <li><code>requests</code>: This module allows you to send HTTP requests using Python. It is likely being used to send
    requests to VRChat's servers to retrieve information about your world or to update your heart rate.</li>
  <li><code>selenium</code>: This module allows you to automate interactions with a web browser. It is being used to log
    in to VRChat, navigate to the relevant pages, and perform actions such as updating your status or clicking buttons.
  </li>
  <li><code>selenium.webdriver.chrome.options.Options</code>: This class is part of the selenium library and provides a
    way to set options for the Chrome web browser when using the ChromeDriver.</li>
  <li><code>selenium.webdriver.common.by</code>: This module provides a way to specify which elements on a webpage
    should be selected when using the selenium library. The <code>By</code> class is used to specify the element by its
    ID, name, class name, tag name, or other attribute.</li>
  <li><code>selenium.webdriver.common.keys</code>: This module provides a way to send keys to a web page as part of a
    Selenium script. The <code>Keys</code> class allows you to simulate the pressing of keys such as Enter, Backspace,
    and others.</li>
  <li><code>time</code>: This module provides functions for working with time in Python. It is likely being used to
    pause the script for a certain amount of time between actions.</li>
  <li><code>colorama</code>: This module allows you to print colored text to the terminal. It is not clear from the code
    provided how this module is being used.</li>
  <li><code>random</code>: This module provides functions for generating random numbers and performing other random operations. It is likely being used to generate random fluctuations in the simulated heart rate.</li>
  <li><code>datetime</code>: This module provides classes for working with dates and times. It is not clear from the code provided how this module is being used.</li>
  <li><code>vlc</code>: This module is a Python wrapper for the VLC media player. It is not clear from the code provided how this module is being used.</li>
  <li><code>time</code>: This module provides functions for working</li>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>To use this project, simply run the Python script and follow the prompts. You will need to provide your VRChat
  username and password, as well as any required two-factor authentication codes.</p>
  
<h2>Roadmap</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Add support for additional web browsers</li>
  <li>Implement additional functionality for interacting with VRChat (e.g. sending messages, changing avatar appearance)
  </li>
</ul>
